<h3>SpiderMan: Into the Spider Verse</h3>
<p>This animated spiderman movie broke many barriers and had an amazing sound track that I still listen to. It was such a different experience seeing an animated spiderman. I believe it was well-executed and had an amazing storyline along with amazing graphics.</p>
