<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Welcome to My Webpage Portfolio</h2>
<p> I am a System-on-Chip Design-For-Test Engineer currently working at AMD. Although my position has nothing to do with Web-page development, I have a passion for 
  coding which led me to this project. I graduated from McMaster University with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. Through my program, I was fortunate 
to take computer engineering courses that led me to my first co-op placement at AMD. Through my position, I had the opportunity to learn about chip design and testing methodologies
that are currently used in industry to verify and validate the operation of these chips. As I was entering into my co-op, companies transitioned into remote-working because of the widespread of COVID-19. 
Coming from a biomedical background and inspired to make a change somehow (and partly because I was bored), I decided this was a perfect time to learn something new such as web development. After learning the fundamentals of web app development, 
I eventually created a web-app that would report live COVID-19 statistics in Canada through a Graphical user interface. Although, the website is no longer functional, this marked the beginning of my passion in web-app development and that's how you ended up here.

<p>Web app development unlocked a new dimension of creativity for me and this is shown in the projects that I have worked on thus far. Currently, I am continuing to learn more about the fundamentals behind Web-app development to make more meaningful and complex web applications. Stay up to date with 
  my journey in the realm of web development.
